            <p class="small">With the recent surge of signings, the Dodgers are prone to be great far into the future. From signing the league's best player, to signing smaller and less known stars, the Dodgers have a skill of signing impactful players that will help them win well into the future.
                Thanks to these signings, the path for the Dodgers to winning only seems to get easier and easier.

        </ul>
        <p class="small">Although the Dodgers have been known to "choke" in the playoffs, the trends are headed up with 2 recent World Series wins in just the past couple of years. 
            With the Dodgers constantly making it to the Playoffs, they will be able to be better prepared for the playoffs in the upcoming years, giving them an even better chance of winning the World Series once again.

            <p font-size="larger">The constant winning ways in the regular season can play a vital role in how one does in the postseason. 
                You can see in the <a href="#viz1754512366752">graph below</a> how important winning percentage in the regular season can be, and the Dodgers have always been about winning, and always will be.

    <p>Here is a little video talking more about why the Dodgers are the best</p>
    <br><br>

<a href="https://www.espn.com/mlb/story/_/id/42101919/2024-world-series-champions-los-angeles-dodgers-celebration-dominance-parade-freeman-betts-ohtani" target="_blank" style="size: larger;">You could also click on this link which will lead you to be able to read an article about the Dodgers recent dominance and how they have come to be this good.</a> <!--link to external websit-->
<br><br>
   <h1 class="bold">Conclusion</h1>
   <p>After reading all of these reasons, watching the video, and looking at the graph, it is clear to see that the Dodgers should be your clear pick for the best organization in baseball and the best team in the league.
    Based off of the success in the past and the recent additions that will lead the team in years to come, the Dodgers are prone to continue to have great years and be annual contenders to win the World Series every year. 
    They have only continued to get stronger and stronger and given what has been done in the past, they will not shy away from signing or trading for even more star players. 
    In my opinion, they are also the most fun team to watch with the best fanbase. 
    Los Angeles is already a pretty cool city, and the Dodgers being in LA only add to it.
